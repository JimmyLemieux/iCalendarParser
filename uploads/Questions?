-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change fscanf for the version property to return bad if "2.0f" for example

Line folds still need to be done

I might need to change the part for the invalid event vs invalid calendar
										invalid alarm vs invalid calendar

Need to work on the felxible array members. On the allocating a new prop

What if you have a line with the first character being the : and text (should be invalid event or anything)

If you find an end before you find a begin then it is INV_CAL

Fix the line ending function

ADD LINE FOLDING!!!

I Still need to add a better date time checker that checks for a valid date and version

If a line contains nothing at all, then it is an INV_CAL

Need to figure out the line folding method, when freeing I am getting an error
